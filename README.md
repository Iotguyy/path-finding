# Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a web-based tool for visualizing various algorithms, allowing users to understand how they work through interactive visualizations. It is intended for educational purposes and can be used to learn about algorithms such as sorting, searching, pathfinding, and more.

## Features

- Visualization of various algorithms including sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort), searching algorithms (e.g., Binary Search), and pathfinding algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's Algorithm, A* Search).
- Interactive user interface with controls for customizing input data, adjusting speed, and pausing/resuming visualizations.
- Ability to generate random input data for algorithms, allowing users to experiment with different scenarios.
- Real-time visualization updates, providing users with immediate feedback as algorithms progress.
- Detailed explanations and step-by-step visualizations to aid in understanding algorithm behavior.
